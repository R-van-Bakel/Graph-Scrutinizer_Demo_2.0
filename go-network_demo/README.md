# Go-Network
## Introduction
For this demo you will import and use the Go-Network. The Go-Network is a library that offers graph generation and sampling algorithms. This demo uses the Go programming language.

We have already set up a basic module to import the Go-Network from [github.com/jmCodeCraft/go-network](), so the demo will mostly focus on playing around with *main.go*.

# Google Form
We have a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvQgYfAaGZT3zr9S74O1VlaZg1Lwj1bh5Rq-Wxj5AX8T4mCA/viewform?usp=header) in which you get to answer some questions, relating to the usabilty of the tool and ease of the demo. Please read through the respective section of the form briefly, before continuing with the instructions.

# Instructions
We have set up some code to run in the `main.go` file. To get started with working with the code, follow the next instructions:

1. If you haven't done so already, open any terminal, navigate to the parent directory (`Graph-Scrutinizer_Demo_2.0/`) and start the Docker container with the following command:

    ```
    make
    ```

2. In the terminal running the Docker container, navigate to the current directory (`Graph-Scrutinizer_Demo_2.0/go-network_demo`).

3. Whenever any further instruction requires you run the code, just run the following command in the Docker terminal:

    ```
    go run main.go
    ```

4. Open the `main.go` in your favorite IDE. It containts four tests to run and play around with. If you don't have Go installed on your own machine (remember we only installed Go in the Docker container) then you will likely not get full language support. We have made the demo code straightforward, so this should not be an issue.

5. Play around with each of the tests (see the comments in `main.go` for more details). After setting up a test, execute it by running the command described in step 3.

6. Finally fill in and submit the Google form provided above.
